/*transiet is a modifer applicable only for variables
 If u dont want to save a value of a particular variable at the time of serializtion use transient keyword which lets jvm ignore the actual value of that keyword and sva ethe defualt value to the file 
 TRANSIENT MEANS NOT TO SERIALIZE
 -------------STATIC VS TRANSIENT VS FINAL----------
 Static variables are not part of the object state and wont take part in serialization 
 Declaring a Static Variable as transient there is no use or impact
 variables which are declared as final will participate in serialization regardless if it is also decraled as transient 
 thus dont declare a transient variable final
